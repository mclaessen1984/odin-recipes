            <h4>Preparation</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>On the evening before dry the meat with paper towels and remove excess fat. When you leave excess
                    fat, the rub won't be absorbed properly. After removing fat rub the BBQ rub onto the meat.</li>
                <li>Take the meat out of the fridge an hour before starting to cook the meat.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 100 degrees.</li>
                <li>Put the meat in a roasting pan.</li>
                <li>Pour half of the BBQ over the meat, cover the roasting pan with aluminium foil and put it in the
                    oven.</li>
                <li>Cook the meat for 4 hours at 120 degrees. After that, increase the temperature to 150 degrees and
                    leave cook the meat for another 3 hours. Half an hour before the end of the cook time, remove the
                    aluminium
                    foil. This will allow the meat to form a bark.</li>
                <li>The meat is ready to pull when the core temperature has reached +/- 88 degrees. How long this will
                    take depends on the size and other characteristics of the meat. Increasing temperature will decrease
                    the
                    time this will take. However, the slower, the more flavour the meat will develop. Test tenderness by
                    pulling some meat. If the meat can't be easily pulled, leave the meat for another 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Take the meat out of the oven and leave it to rest for half an hour.</li>
                <li>Pull the meat using two forks.</li>
                <li>Serve the meat on buns.</li>
